# Udacity Project 5: Restaurant Reviews (Stage 1)
---
#### Lindsay Ciastko

## Introduction

In Restaurant Reviews Stage 1, I took pre-existing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and offline-first version of the original code. In this project, I added accessibility ARIA labels and fixed the responsiveness so that the site can work on all devices and platforms. Additionally, I have added a service worker to create an offline user experience.

### Installation

To run this locally, first download or clone this repository.

Then, in a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

These instructions were taken from [this starter repository](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1).

### Dependencies

### Note about ES6
Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, try to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript you write.
